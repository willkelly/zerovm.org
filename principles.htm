					<h2>The Principles Behind ZeroVM</h2>
                    <p>ZeroVM was founded on some key design tenets, which set it apart from other
technologies. Use cases that require or emphasize several of these principles
will most likely be a good application of the ZeroVM technology.</p>

					<h3>Small, Light, Fast</h3>
                    <p>ZeroVM is extremely small, lightweight, and fast. An execution
environment can start in as little as 5 milliseconds. By eliminating the
operating system and only providing enough functionality to run simple
applications, ZeroVM allows the creation of new execution environments for each
user/request.

Traditional hypervisors also create ongoing overhead by inserting
themselves between the virtual machine and the hardware.  ZeroVM can pre-validate
executables resulting in little to no overhead at runtime.</p>

					<h3>Secure</h3>
                    <p>ZeroVM provides a completely secure and isolated
execution environment. The security is derived from the Chromium Native Client
(NaCl) project and is based on the concept of software fault isolation. ZeroVM
creates a secure sandbox and validates all code that is executed inside the
sandbox, ensuring a program will not accidentaly or malicously break out. This
level of security allows for the execution of arbitrary user code even in
untrusted multi-tenant environments like public cloud storage services.
Find out more about about Native Client on the
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/">NaCl project website</a> and
in the
<a href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/34913.pdf">
original NaCl white paper</a>.</p>

					<h3>Hyper-Scalable</h3>
                    <p>ZeroVM makes it easy to create large clusters of instances,
aggregating the compute power of many individual physical servers into a single execution
environment. Users can leverage the power of 100s of physical servers for a few
seconds or even milliseconds at time. Users can also define arbitrary connections between
these instances, creating a sequentional processing pipeline or a directed acylic graph.</p>

					<h3>Embeddable</h3>
                    <p>ZeroVM is designed to be embedded into existing storage systems.
By embedding ZeroVM inside an existing storage system, for example, you can
push your applicaiton to your data and run computations in situ, rather than
paying the latency cost of piping data from storage to compute nodes. This can
provide functionality equivalent to stored procedures for a variety of
different storage systems.

An example of this capability is<a href="https://github.com/zerovm/zerocloud">
ZeroCloud</a>, a middleware application for OpenStack Swift which embeds
ZeroVM on storage nodes and enables arbitrary in-place computation on
collections of objects.</p>

                    <h3>Functional (Deterministic)</h3>
                    <p>Execution inside a ZeroVM environment is functionaly pure or
deterministic, meaning that for any given set of inputs ZeroVM will always produce
the exact same output. This makes it possible to run multiple copies of an operation
in parallel ensuring you will get the exact same result from each copy.  It also
allows you to stop and start execution and even replay operations without
impacting the output.</p>
